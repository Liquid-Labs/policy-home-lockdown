# Isolating Individuals within the Household

## Purpose and scope

This document provides step-by-step instructions and checklists for use in isolating an individual from others in the household.

## Procedure

Refer to [guidelines for when to isolate]({{ .families.standards.HOUSEHOLD_ISOLATION_STANDARDS }}#guidelines-for-when-to-isolate)

### Preparation

1. If you can, dedicate a a separate room, with a door for the isolated individual.

- everything that goes into or comes out of the room is considered contaminated
- we don't worry about pants or shoes

- if possible use all disposable stuff
  - if you do need to use utensils plates, etc., put items from in the room directly into sink and spay with bleach and let sit, then rinse.
- preferrably in their own room with their own bathroom
- setup an area to prepare before entering room; this could be as simple as a table; gowns (shirts), gloves, sanitizer
- wash your hands
- mask
- gloves second
- if you have gowns, great. If not, use a clean shirt, put it on backwards. No need to close, your back is never considered sterile
- keep distance whenever possible
- forget about recyclyngi; if you have anything to throw away, have another person hold a separate back, fold the top down and over so the inside of the bag covers hands and the outside is protected. Put the bag from the room into the outer bag, have helper fold up and then close
- do the same with linens and linen bags
- if you don't have a helper, prepare the outer bags before entering and then fold up after removing gloves, wash hands, then wash hands again
- take off gloves first, then gown, then mask
