# Isolating Individuals within the Household

## Purpose and scope

This document provides step-by-step instructions and checklists for use in isolating an individual from others in the household.

## Procedure

Refer to [guidelines for when to isolate]({{ .families.standards.HOUSEHOLD_ISOLATION_STANDARDS }}#guidelines-for-when-to-isolate)

### General guidelines

* Read through the entire procedure prior to execution.
* Anything that comes out of the room should be considered "dirty" and must be either disposed of or disinfected.
* Even when "suited up", maintain distance from the patient as much as possible. E.g., if you have to fiddle with something, step away from the bedside.
* In general, the upper body is going to be protected and the lower body is considered "dirty" by default anyway, so it is not advised to change pants and shoes under normal circumstances. If, however, the patient sneezed directly on your pants, you will want to change them.
* Use your judgement and think your actions through beforehand.
* Where you cannot follow the guidelines precisely, do the best you can. Anything is better than nothing, even if the effect is mainly to keep you aware and thinking. Care, washing hands, and extra hygiene can go a long way.
* On the other hand, all the protective equipment in the world will provide no benefit if used carelessly or incorrectly.
* To the extent you are able, forget about recycle and re-using. If you can use all paper plates and plastic utensils that get thrown away, that's best. It is generally possible to disinfect and reuse, but the extra steps mean more chances to make mistakes and spread infection. In most home situations, however, this will not be possible, especially if protective equipment is in high  demand. The mask, glove, and gown guidelines all provide good alternatives to medical-grade disposable items.

### Preparation

1. If you can, dedicate a a separate room, with a door for the isolated individual. Preferably, with an attached bathroom for their exclusive use.
   * If you have a "Hollywood bathroom" with attached to multiple rooms, lock or tape off the other door to prevent access.
   * If you don't have a separate room with a door, use plastic sheeting to seal a doorway if possible.
   * If there is no option to "seal" the patient into a contained area, then locate the patient in a corner furthest from everyone else to maximize distance.
      * Turn off any fans and use AC sparingly to avoid circulating air within the room.
      * While opening windows and providing fresh air is good, or when fans or AC must be used, be mindful of circulation and avoid drawing air from the patient's area into the rest of the room.
2. Set up a preparation area outside the door the isolation room with:
   * a tray for carrying things into and out of the room
   * trash bags
   * sprayable disinfectant (TODO: provide disinfectant guidelines)
   * a designated "dirty" sink or large plastic bins
   * clean masks (refer to [mask usage guidelines]({{ .families.HOME_LOCKDOWN_FRAMEWORK}}#mask-usage-guidelines)
   * clean gloves (refer to [glove usage guidelines]({{ .families.HOME_LOCKDOWN_FRAMEWORK}}#gloves-usage-guidelines)
   * clean gowns [gown usage guidelines]({{ .families.HOME_LOCKDOWN_FRAMEWORK}}#gown-usage-guidelines)
   * If you can  designate an area on the counter/table outside the room as "dirty", make sure it is clear. Since the floor is always "dirty" you can also place exposed items on the floor after exiting the room.
3. Using the procedures below, we will also supply the patient with a ziplock bag and a supply of masks for their own use as well. This will be placed within easy reach with 1-2 clean masks in one ziplock bag. A second bag (which need not seal) should be used for dirty masks.
4. If possible, keep anything the patient might need in the room with the patient. This minimizes the need to bring items in and out of the room. If possible:
   * dedicate a thermometer to the patient.
   * have a supply of disposable plates, bowls, and utensils in the room.
5. Print or hand-copy the "[entering](#entering-the-room)" and "[exiting](#exiting-the-room)" instructions and tape/pin them to a wall so that they can be easily read without needing to touch anything.

### Entering the room

1. Change into a fitted short-sleeved shirt if at all possible and tuck it in.
2. Wash your hands thoroughly.
3. Remove any rings or other jewelry/accessories. Tuck any necklaces into your shirt.
4. Prepare whatever you plan to take into the room on a clean tray.
5. Select a "room trash bag". This should be large enough to contain anything you'll need to dispose of while leaving ample room in the bag. As a rule of thumb, you want the bag to be less than half full in order to ease handling and to avoid spills.
6. Prepare an "outer trash bag". We will place disposable gloves/mask/gown and then the "room trash bag" here.
   1. The bin/bucket should have as relatively wide opening to be able to deposit items easily without the need to stuff things down. You'll need to be able to fit the filled room trash bag into the outer trash bag.
   2. Place a new bag in a trash bin or bucket.
   3. Fold the edges of the bag down around the bin/bucket so there's a 2-3+ inches of folded bag and secure/tighten where possible to avoid pulling the edges down later on when the room trash bag is placed in this outer trash bag.
   4. Alternatively, if you have a helper, they can hold the outer trash bag open for you.
7. Ensure the designated "dirty" sink or plastic bin is clear. This is where we will put re-usable items to be disinfected.
8. Have a laundry basket or similar in place for dirty linens. Even if "just in case".
9. If you have a washing machine, open it. If not, have a designated spot to place "exposed" laundry separate from normal laundry. This should be somewhere where neither kids nor animals can play around with it, such as in a separate closet.
10. Arrange your tray and room trash bag near the door.
11. Don your mask.
12. Don your gloves.
13. Don your gown.
14. Announce that you are about to enter the room and remind the patient to don their own mask if they are able.
15. Open the door, pick up the tray, and enter.

### Exiting the room

1. Before exiting, gather everything you will taking out of the room:
   1. Put items to be disposed in the room trash bag. Without trapping too much air, twist and tie the bag securely closed.
   2. Gather linens to be removed by the door.
   3. Arrange other re-usable items on your tray and gather any linens by the door.
2. When ready to leave, open the door and move linens to prepared laundry basket. As much as possible, keep the linens at arms length.
3. Place the room trash bag from the room on the floor (not touching anything) and place your tray either in the designated spot or on the floor.
4. Remove your gloves.
   * If using disposable gloves, drop them in the prepared trash bin.
   * If using reusable gloves, place them in the dirty sink/bin.
5. If possible, remove your gown by bending forward and letting it fall into the laundry basket. If it's necessary to pull on the gown, grasp it by the edges.
6. Wash your hands.
7. If you are using a re-usable mask, remove it now and add it to the laundry. Otherwise, dispose of it in the outer trash bag.
8. Deposit the room trash bag inside the outer trash bag.
   * If you're on your own, be careful not to pull the folded edges of the outer bag in.
   * If you have a helper, have them  fold a generous portion of the top of the outer bag around their hands and arms so they are completely covered, then grip the outer trash bag from this position securely.
9. Securely close the outer trash bag.
   1. Lift the folded up, only touching the outside of the outer bag. If using a bin, slip the hands under the fold and lift up.
   2. Remove excess air, twist, and tie the bag to securely close.
9. Place any items to be disinfected in the prepared bin/sink.
   1. Spray each side of any re-usable items with disinfectant and place them in the dirty sink/bin.
   2. Take the tray itself and do the same.
   3. Allow to sit for 3+ hours, then wash (by hand or in dishwasher) and rinse thoroughly.
10. If the try was placed on a table or counter, thoroughly spray or wipe that area with disinfectant and let it air dry. It is not necessary to disinfect the floor if that was used.
11. Slip your hands under the trash-bag fold on either side and lift up, touching only the outside of the bag. Grasp the bag, twist close, secure the bag, and dispose of the bag in the standard manner.
12. Take the laundry basket to the washing machine or designated "exposed laundry" spot. If you have a washing machine, put the linens in start the cycle. Use hot water if possible.
13. If possible, place the laundry basket someplace where children/pets/the unwary might mess with it and thoroughly spray or wipe it with disinfectant so that the entire surface area as wetted and let it air dry.
14. Disinfect any surface you or anything from within the room might have touched during the cleanup process.
   * The "dirty" portion of the counter or table, if any.
   * The washing machine controls and outer surface that may have contacted the linens.
   * The handle to the patients room.
15. Wash your hands thoroughly.
16. Dispose of the "outer" trash bag in the standard manner.
17. Replenish supplies in the preparation area as necessary.
