# Home Lockdown Framework

## Purpose and scope

Our aim is to provide comprehensive and clear guidance regarding expectations, purpose, and implementation of a home lockdown protocol suitable during the {{ .SCOPE_STATEMENT }}. The aim is to, as much as possible, keep you, your family and household, and all your neighbors and fellow humans safe and well. At the same time, we hope to provide clear instructions and context to reduce anxiety and make this difficult situation a little bit easier.

## Overview

The home lockdown framework is designed to provide clear guidance on the essential reasons for, expectations in, and how to implement a home lockdown protocol. Because this is intended as a guide for "the majority of people in the rich world", we attempt to provide guidance on what to do and how to use this framework for individual situations while providing specific and clear instructions.

To understand the reasons behind and goals of the lockdown, please refer to the [Home Lockdown Policy]({{ .families.policies.HOME_LOCKDOWN_POLICY }}) document. The standards document provide a clear enumeration on expectations. The procedures documents provide step-by-step instructions on how to implement a home lockdown.

## Guidelines for necessary work outside the home

## Mask usage guidelines

Airborne transmission occurs primarily when exhaled water droplets and, potentially, vapor containing the virus are inhaled. The purpose of a mask is to capture the water containing the virus before someone else can breath it in.

* Any mask will become ineffective when it becomes saturated.
* To be effective, you must breath through the mask, so the seal around the face is critical.
* Coughing, sneezing, and heavy breathing will blow out the seal and allow unfiltered breath to escape.

### N95 masks

* An N95 mask is effective at filtering water vapor.
* When the filter becomes saturated, it can no longer filter effectively and the mask must be changed. Check the documentation to determine the recommended usage time.
* When in short supply, place used masks in a paper bag to allow it to dry. Write the user's name on the bag and only the same person should reuse a mask.

### Cotton shields

* Other, non-N95 masks may be referred to as "shields" as they don't filter so much as simple block large droplets.
* Such masks can still be effective at improving one's odds when used in conjunction with social distancing and other best practices.
* Part of the function of the mask is to serve as a reminder to others and yourself to observe social distance and also to avoid touching one's face.

### Producing your own shields

There are countless online tutorials for how to produce cotton shields using old t-shirts, bandanas, and other material. One of the easiest methods that requires no sewing is:

1. Fold a bandana or other square cotton cloth into a long rectangle, producing 2+ layers of fabric (a triple fold is illustrated here):
    ```
     -------------------------------------
    |                                     |
    |                                     |
    --------------------------------------- <- fold here
    |                                     |
    |                                     |
    --------------------------------------- <- and here
    |                                     |
    |                                     |
     -------------------------------------
    ```
2. Pull the rectangle of fabric through two elastic hair ties. If you don't have hair ties, rubber bands can be used, though these will tend to irritate the skin more.
    ```
     -----|------------------------|-------
    |     |                        |       |
    |     |                        |       |
     -----|------------------------|-------
    ```
3. Now form a circle with rectangle of fabric and tuck one end inside the other.
4. Bring the hair ties to either edge, placing the fabric over your noes and mouth and the ties around the ears.
5. Adjust the fabric to produce a seal.

## Glove usage guidelines

* For general purposes, it's better to wash your hands than to wear gloves all the time.
* Once used once, gloves are contaminated and it would generally be better to remove the glove and just use your bare hands followed by a good wash than to re-use the same pair of gloves.
* The general rule is 1 pair of gloves per interaction.
* From [Medline.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000452.htm)

### Donning gloves

1. Pinch the first glove by the base edge and let it fall open.
2. Work the other hand into the glove. You may pull the glove from the base, but do not touch any other part of the glove with the ungloved hand.
3. Repeat this procedure with the second glove.

### Removing gloves

1. Have a trash bag/can open and ready so you can drop the used gloves in without touching anything.
2. Pinch the base edge of the first glove and pull up, ideally turning the glove inside out.
3. Throw that glove away.
4. With the now-ungloved hand, reach two fingers inside the second glove, careful to not touch the outside.
5. With the fingers hooked, pull up towards the fingertips and pinch the glove with your free hand from the inside. Remember, inside clean, outside dirty. The second glove should also turn inside out.
6. Throw away the second glove.

### Using re-usable gloves

* If supplies of single-use sterilized gloves are not available, you can use rubber gloves that one would use for housework or dishwashing.
* After each interaction, remove the gloves and place directly in a sink with a stopper or a plastic bin.
* Soak the used gloves in a disinfecting bleach solution before reusing. (TODO: link to disinfecting guidelines and provide guidance on time to soak.)

## Gown usage guidelines

* Assuming that medical-style gowns are not available, one can use a button up shirt. Reverse the shirt so it's open at the back.
* Unless using surgical style gowns with wrap around ties, leave the gown open in back. You will be facing the patient and the goal is to shield the front of the body.

### Donning a gown

* If possible, have a helper hold the gown at the edges so you can slip your arms into the gown without touching it yourself.
* If no one is available, arrange the gown so that you can slip your hands into the gown, lift it up, and then let it fall towards your chest.
* When adjusting the gown, always grasp it at the edges.
