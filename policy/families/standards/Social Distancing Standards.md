# Social Distancing Standards

## Purpose and scope

These standards describe the when and how to maintain appropriate social distance during a pandemic or similar outbreak in both public and household interactions.

## Guidelines to maintain social cohesion

Move a little slower and allow space for others to work with you in maintaining social distance and keeping everyone self. These are stressful times and maintaining a sense of compassion and holding consideration for others can do a lot.

## Guidelines for dense urban areas

Maintaining "perfect" social distancing in a dense urban area can be especially challenging or even downright impossible. Use your judgement and apply the standards as best you can.

If possible, the use of a mask or shield may be warranted. Even in cases where the device itself does not provide any direct protection, it can serve as a useful social signaling device that can bring awareness to our collective duties. Others are likely to give you and perhaps reserve for themselves a little more distance and exercise just a bit more caution. This is, however, highly dependent on local customs and circumstances.

## Mask usage guidelines

Only high quality masks rated N95 or above are even potentially effective at actually filtering the virus itself. Lesser masks can provide a limited "shield" effect by blocking the larger droplets of saliva and other fluids. For this reason, these are sometimes referred to as "shields" as opposed to "masks" to distinguish the two.

To provide significant benefit to yourself or others, both masks and shields require proper usage. Always refer to the documentation provided by the manufacturer for instructions for your particular product.

In general, however, there are two primary components to proper usage. First, ensure a good seal around your mouth and nose. Air must be forced to pass through the device for it to have any effect. This also means coughing, sneezing, or even heavy breathing can easily blow out the seal and negate any positive effect.

Second, both masks and shields must be changed, and often frequently to have any effect. After the material of the device becomes saturated, it is no longer able to filter or even shield anything at that point.
