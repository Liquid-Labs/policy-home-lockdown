## Guidelines to maintain social cohesion

Move a little slower and allow space for others to work with you in maintaining social distance and keeping everyone self. These are stressful times and maintaining a sense of compassion and holding consideration for others can do a lot.

## Guidelines for dense urban areas

Maintaining "perfect" social distancing in a dense urban area can be especially challenging or even downright impossible. Use your judgement and apply the standards as best you can.

If possible, the use of a mask or shield may be warranted. Even in cases where the device itself does not provide any direct protection, it can serve as a useful social signaling device that can bring awareness to our collective duties. Others are likely to give you and perhaps reserve for themselves a little more distance and exercise just a bit more caution. This is, however, highly dependent on local customs and circumstances.
